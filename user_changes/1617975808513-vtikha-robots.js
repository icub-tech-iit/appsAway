//&<h3>Field changed in robot: <ins>CER01</ins></h3><ul><li>robot_description: R1- “Your Personal Humanoid”- is born as the new humanoid of the robotic ecosystem of IIT – Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia and has beed designed to operate in domestic and professional environments. R1’s height is variable; its body extends from 125 to 140cm thanks to an extensible bust. Similarly, its arms can extend to 13cm forwards, to reach distant objects. The torso, in addition to moving up and down, can twist sideways. The battery, with an average duration of 3 hours, guarantees the autonomy of the robot. When the battery is low, all that is required is to plug it into a home electrical outlet using a power supply, just like any other household appliance. R1 is able to move in the environments thanks to the wheels, allowing it to reach a maximum speed of 2 km/h, the value that designers have determined as a safety limit. The face of the robot consists of a colour LED screen with stylised faces, which are useful for non-verbal communication with human beings. Patterned by IIT, the screen is thought to have a low cost, and features include vision sensors: 2 stereo cameras and a 3D scanner. For balance, it has an accelerometer and a gyroscope.  For generation and perception of sound, it has speakers and a microphone. The hands and forearms of the robot are covered with an artificial skin, or a sensor that gives the robot a sense of touch, enabling it to feel the interaction with the objects they manipulate.<b>dsadadas</b></li></ul>
