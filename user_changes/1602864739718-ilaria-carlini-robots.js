The iCub is distributed as Open Source following the GPL/LGPL licenses and can now count on a worldwide community of enthusiastic developers. More than 30 robots have been built so far which are available in laboratories in Europe, US, Korea and Japan. It is one of the few platforms in the world with a sensitive full-body skin to deal with safe physical interaction with the environment. IIT coordinates the project and supports the evolution of the iCub from the research platform of today to the low-cost commercial applications of the near future. We take a 360-degree approach to robotics including mechanical design, power sources, new advanced electronics (e.g. neuromorphic), sensor development (e.g. tactile, cameras), middleware, and control and AI algorithms.</li><li>robot_detail: [{header:Serial No.,value:012},{header:Sub-Serial Head,value:012H},{header:Sub-Serial Upper,value:012},{header:Sub-Serial Hands + Forearms,value:<del>012</del><b>TEST</b>},{header:Sub-Serial Lower,value:012<b> TEST</b>},{header:Sub-Serial Legs,value:012},{header:Robot Name,value:iCubAnkara01},{header:Institution,value:METU},{header:Components,value:<b>TEST </b>Full Body},{header:Current Version,value:1.2},{header:Color,value:Yellow},{header:Note,value:n/a}]</li></ul>
