Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code. This particular image is a clean docker containing all the superbuild pre installed so that the user/developer can go straight to work without dealing with cumbersome installations.<b> TEST.</b></li></ul>
